                                <p><strong>Question:</strong> "What emotions do you expect to feel when you get your first job offer? Your first rejection?"</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Offer emotions:</strong> Excitement, relief, anxiety, imposter syndrome</li>

                                    <li><strong>Timing matters:</strong> Right opportunity at wrong time vs. wrong opportunity at right time</li>
                                    <li><strong>Long-term perspective:</strong> Your first job isn't your last job</li>
