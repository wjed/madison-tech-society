                            <h3>Opening: The Emotional Rollercoaster of Job Searching</h3>
                            <div class="talking-points">
                                <p><strong>Question:</strong> "What emotions do you expect to feel when you get your first job offer? Your first rejection?"</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Offer emotions:</strong> Excitement, relief, anxiety, imposter syndrome ("Do I really deserve this?")</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rejection emotions:</strong> Disappointment, self-doubt, frustration, sometimes motivation to try harder</li>
                                    <li>Both are normal and expected—everyone in the room will experience them</li>
                                    <li>Your response to both (staying professional, learning, and moving forward) determines your long-term success more than any single outcome</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> How you handle these moments can be more important than the moments themselves. A graceful rejection response can lead to a future opportunity; a thoughtful offer evaluation can set you up for years of growth.</p>
                                
                                <h4>The Psychology of Job Search Outcomes:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Offers aren't always victories:</strong> Accepting the wrong fit for money or prestige can slow your growth or burn you out</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rejections aren't always failures:</strong> Often about fit, timing, or internal candidates—not your ability</li>
                                    <li><strong>Timing matters:</strong> Right opportunity at the wrong time (e.g., too early in your prep) vs. wrong opportunity at the right time—both happen</li>
                                    <li><strong>Long-term perspective:</strong> Your first job is a step, not the destination. Most people change roles or companies within a few years</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Reframing for Resilience:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Treat every interview as practice for the next one</li>
                                    <li>Treat every offer as information—you now know your market value</li>
                                    <li>Treat every rejection as feedback, when you can get it</li>
                                    <li>Keep a running list of what you're learning so setbacks feel like progress</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Questions to Ask the Hiring Manager or Recruiter (Before You Decide):</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What does a typical day or week look like for someone in this role?</li>

                                <p><strong>Making Your Case:</strong></p>
                                <p>"Based on my research and the unique value I bring through [specific skills/projects], I was hoping we could consider a base salary of $X, which would be more in line with market rates for someone with my background."</p>

                                <p><strong>Asking for More Time (When You Have Other Interviews or Offers):</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>If They Say No to Your Salary Ask:</strong></p>
                                <p>"I understand the salary may be fixed for this level. Are there other aspects of the package we could discuss, such as the signing bonus, start date, or professional development budget? I want to make this work and am flexible on how we get there."</p>

                                <p><strong>If They Say "We Can't Do More at All":</strong></p>
                                <p>"I appreciate you looking into it. The opportunity and team are still very important to me. I'll need a few days to think it over and will get back to you by [date] with my decision."</p>
                                <p>Then actually take the time. Don't agree on the spot unless you're genuinely ready. It's okay to say you need to think.</p>

                                <h4>The 10-10-10 Rule:</h4>
                                <ul>

                            <div class="talking-points">
                                <p><strong>Feeling Like You Don't Deserve It Is Common—Here's How to Handle It</strong></p>
                                
                                <p>Many people feel doubt or anxiety after receiving an offer: "Did they make a mistake?" "Am I going to be found out?" This is imposter syndrome, and it's especially common at big career milestones like your first job.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Why It Happens:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You're comparing your behind-the-scenes (your doubts, mistakes, learning curve) to everyone else's highlight reel</li>
                                    <li>New environments feel unfamiliar, and it's easy to assume everyone else "belongs" more than you</li>
                                    <li>You might be the first in your family or circle to land a role like this—there's no script</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>What Helps:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>They chose you.</strong> The team saw your skills, potential, and fit. Trust their process.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Everyone starts somewhere.</strong> Senior people once had a first day too.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Focus on learning, not proving.</strong> Your job is to grow and contribute, not to be perfect from day one.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Talk about it.</strong> Mentors, friends, or MTS peers—many have felt the same way.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If the offer is fair and the role excites you, accept that you earned it and get ready to learn on the job.</p>
